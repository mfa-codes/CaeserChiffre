# CaeserChiffre

This is a smaller short code for the Caeser cipher encryption method. This code I wrote completely in Python. The file "CaeserCheffire.py" contains the methods for encryption as well as decryption. The file "main.py" uses the methods and starts the program.

Caesar encryption is a simple symmetric encryption method based on monographic and monoalphabetic substitution. It is very easy to understand but it is very unsafe
